The deep convolutional
neural network model has shown an excellent performance,
securing the 13th position with 92.72% testing accuracy in the
Bengali handwritten digit recognition challenge 2019 among 57
participating teams. <br>
We implemented the same procedure and found an accuracy of 99.70% accuracy for MNIST digit recognition whereas the state of the art of MNIST dataset is 99.79%.<br>
We also found 99.79% accuracy for EMNIST digit recognition and 90.59% accuracy for EMNIST letter recognition which has 47 balanced letter classes. Which is an increased accuracy.
